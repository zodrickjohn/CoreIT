<h1 align="center">🔗 CoreIT - Compute Without Limits</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>A decentralized distributed job execution system</b><br>
  <i>Rent & utilize idle compute power securely for AI, 3D rendering, and large-scale tasks.</i>
</p>

---

## 🚨 Problem

> Access to high-performance computing is **expensive**, **centralized**, and **inaccessible** for many — especially students, indie developers, and under-resourced regions.

💡 **60% of personal devices** stay **idle most of the day**, wasting potential compute resources.

---

## 💡 Solution: CoreIT

CoreIT bridges the compute gap by enabling users to:

- 📤 Upload jobs (AI, graphics, compute-heavy)
- 🧠 Execute them securely on idle machines (lenders)
- 🔐 Ensure privacy using **Zero Knowledge Proofs**
- 💸 Reward providers via **Solana Blockchain**

---

## 📘 Real-World Scenarios

### 👩‍🎓 Aisha – The Struggling Student

> Aisha is building a **Blender animation** and an AI model on **neural style transfer**.  
> Her **4GB RAM laptop crashes** frequently, and **Google Colab times out**.

✅ With **CoreIT**, Aisha:
- Uploads code securely
- Leverages a high-end lender's GPU
- Gets results fast, at low cost — **without exposing her code**

---

### 👨‍💻 Arnav – The Idle GPU Owner

> Arnav owns a **powerful RTX 4080 PC** that's idle during the day.  
> He wants to **earn passively** but values **security and privacy**.

✅ With **CoreIT**, Arnav:
- Accepts containerized jobs
- Executes tasks in an **encrypted sandbox**
- Earns micro-payments securely without seeing any client code

## 🧠 System Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/ChatGPT Image May 29, 2025, 04_42_22 PM.png" width="80%" alt="Architecture Overview">
</p>

### 🔐 Client Flow
1. Authenticate & upload code
2. Code is zipped & containerized
3. Stored temporarily on **Google Cloud**
4. Pushed to **Docker Hub**
5. Metadata is logged on **Solana Blockchain**
6. Encrypted sandbox is created & verified

### 🖥️ Lender Flow
1. Lender authenticates & accepts job
2. Pulls container from Docker Hub
3. Executes inside sandbox
4. Results returned securely to client
5. Job queue managed via **Redis**
